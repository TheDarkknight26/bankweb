```
## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set up the development environment:


# Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheDarkknight26/bankappnew.git
```
# Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd bankweb
```
# Install backend dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install
```
# Install frontend dependencies
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```
## Running the Application

To run the application locally, you'll need to start both the backend server and the frontend application. Follow these steps to get your project up and running:

1. **Start the backend server**:

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the `server` directory of your project using the `cd` command:
     ```bash
     cd server
     ```
   - Once inside the `server` directory, start the backend server using `nodemon` (a tool that automatically restarts the server when changes are made):
     ```bash
     nodemon index.js
     ```
   - The backend server should now be running and listening for incoming requests.

2. **Start the frontend application**:

   - Open another terminal or command prompt window.
   - Navigate to the `client` directory of your project using the `cd` command:
     ```bash
     cd client
     ```
   - Once inside the `client` directory, start the frontend application using npm (Node Package Manager):
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - The frontend development server will start, and your default web browser should automatically open the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port if 3000 is occupied).

Now, both the backend server and frontend application are running concurrently. You can interact with your web application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Project Structure

│ ├── public/ # Static assets and index.html
│ │ ├── assets/ # Images and other static files
│ │ ├── index.html # HTML template for the React app
│ ├── src/ # Source code
│ │ ├── components/ # React components
│ │ ├── context/ # React context files
│ │ ├── App.css # CSS styles for App component
│ │ ├── App.js # Main component of the React app
│ │ ├── index.js # Frontend entry point
│ │ ├── index.css # Global CSS styles
│ │ └── setupTests.js # Test setup configuration
│ └── package.json # Frontend dependencies and scripts
├── .gitignore # Git ignore file
├── package.json # Project dependencies and scripts
└── package-lock.json # Dependency lock file (generated by npm)
```
The project is structured into two main directories: `server` and `client`, representing the backend server and frontend application, respectively. Let's explain each directory's purpose:

### Backend Directory (`server/`):

- `models/`: This directory contains MongoDB schemas and models. It defines how data will be structured and stored in the database.

- `routes/`: The `routes` directory holds the API routes and main logic for the backend. It handles incoming requests and defines the behavior of the backend.

- `config.js`: This file contains configuration settings for the backend, such as database connection parameters, API keys, or other environment-specific settings.

- `index.js`: The `index.js` file is the entry point for the backend application. It sets up the server, connects to the database, and starts listening for incoming requests.

### Client Directory (`client/`):

- `public/`: The `public` directory contains static assets and the `index.html` file. Static assets, such as images or fonts, can be stored in the `assets` subdirectory.

- `src/`: The `src` directory contains the source code for the frontend application.

  - `components/`: This directory holds the React components used in the application. Each component is a reusable piece of the user interface.

  - `context/`: The `context` directory contains React context files, which allow data to be shared across multiple components without having to pass props manually.

  - `App.css`: The `App.css` file contains CSS styles specific to the main component of the React app, typically named `App.js`.

  - `App.js`: The `App.js` file is the main component of the React app. It serves as the entry point for the frontend application.

  - `index.js`: The `index.js` file is the entry point for the frontend application. It renders the main component (`App.js`) and sets up the React app.

  - `index.css`: The `index.css` file contains global CSS styles that apply to the entire application.

  - `setupTests.js`: The `setupTests.js` file is used for configuring test-related settings for the application.

### Other Files:

- `.gitignore`: The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git version control. It helps to exclude unnecessary or sensitive files from being committed.

- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: These files define the project's dependencies, scripts, and other important metadata. `package-lock.json` is automatically generated by npm and helps ensure consistent installations of packages across different environments.

The well-organized project structure enables developers to easily navigate and understand the codebase, making it more maintainable and scalable in the long run.
